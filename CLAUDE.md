# CLAUDE.md

A static recompilation of the N64 *Paper Mario* (USA) with N64Recomp, N64ModernRuntime, RecompFrontend and RT64, from
the pmret/papermario decompilation. Almost all of it is written by AI agents, so this file is what the next one needs:
the rules, where things are, and the facts about the game the code can't say on its own.

## What lives where

This repo is the game: its recompilation, the patches over it, the desktop build and its web page.

- `syms/`: the symbols N64Recomp reads, written from the decomp's own build of the ROM (`tools/build_decomp.sh`, then
  `tools/gen_syms.sh` and `tools/gen_syms.py`, whose header says how), never edited by hand: every code section of the
  game with its ROM offset and VRAM, the functions named as the decomp names them.
- `us.toml`: N64Recomp's configuration, with the game's hooks; `tools/recompile.sh` writes `RecompiledFuncs/` with it,
  and the audio microcode with `aspMain.us.toml`.
- `patches/` and `patches.toml`: MIPS C against `lib/papermario`'s headers, recompiled into PatchesLib, where a patch to
  the game's C goes (`patches/Makefile`'s header says how they build; `patches/dummy_headers/` stands in for the headers
  the decomp generates in its build). `ui_funcs.h`, `patch_helpers.h` and `recompui_event_structs.h` are
  RecompFrontend's, which includes the first from the game's `patches/`.
- `src/`: RecompFrontend's main (`src/main/main.cpp`, with the GameEntry), the code sections and patches it gives the
  runtime (`src/main/register_overlays.cpp`, `src/main/register_patches.cpp`), the natives `us.toml`'s hooks and the
  patches call (`src/game/recomp_api.cpp`), the libultra functions the runtime lacks (`src/game/libultra.cpp`), the
  settings, and on Windows a stack trace on a crash (`src/main/crash_trace.cpp`).
- `lib/`: `papermario` (the decomp, for the patches' headers and `syms/`), upstream `rt64`, `N64ModernRuntime` and
  `RecompFrontend` at the commits N64Recomp-browser's web forks are built on, and `N64Recomp-browser` at a release tag.
  The web support every recomp's page shares is developed and documented there; `tools/build_n64recomp.sh` and
  `CMakeLists.txt` apply its `patches/` to the other three, and `CMakeLists.txt` then this game's own changes to them
  (`runtime-patches/`, its README lists them).
- `docs/web.md`: the web page: `tools/build_web.sh`, its prebuilt shader list (`src/rt64_shaders.txt`,
  `tools/shader_plan.json`, `tools/record_shaders.sh`), its play plans (`tools/play_plan*.json`) and the survey they
  share (`tools/shader_survey.js`), which takes the game to any map or the attract demo as its own code does.
- Comments beside the code, for how and why: each file's header. Read the header of the file you change and update
  it in the same commit.

## Rules

- No ROMs, ROM-derived assets or extracted game data in git, CI or PRs (`tools/ci/check_repo.py` checks). Nothing
  from the decomp's assets or its build is committed but `syms/`. The launcher's art is text only (`icons/`): no logo,
  character or picture from the game.
- The desktop releases are built where the ROM is, by `tools/release.sh` (its header says how), and published to
  GitHub Releases with their notes in `releases/`.
- The scope is the game as it plays, plus what a web page needs (RT64 interpolation to the display's rate, resolution
  Auto), plus modern enhancements: each an option with an Original value that plays as the console does, none
  changing how the game plays. USA only.
- Code from any other Paper Mario project may be read for what it changes, but nothing that isn't the decomp's or CC0
  is copied.
- Write for a stranger, in the present tense: nothing about a contributor's machine, servers, paths or accounts, and
  nothing about where anyone keeps ROMs.
- GPL-3.0, as the recompilations it follows.

## How it fits together

- **The code.** `.main` (ROM 0x1000, VRAM 0x80025C00, the entry point) is stored raw in the ROM, and the runtime maps
  what lies in ROM 0x1000 plus 1 MB at start. Everything else is an overlay: the engine's second half, each area's maps,
  battles, partners, the effects, the file and pause menus. The game copies code out of ROM three ways (nuPiReadRom,
  dma_copy in 0x2000-byte pieces through it, and nuPiReadRomOverlay), and a hook at each (`us.toml`) tells the runtime
  what is about to be copied (`pm_load_overlays`, `src/main/register_overlays.cpp`). Many overlays share a VRAM.
- **The effects** run at 0xE0000000 and up behind the TLB: `src/game/recomp_api.cpp` backs that stretch with memory of
  its own and the TLB calls do nothing (its header says why that is the same mapping). On a page that stretch is about
  1.5 GB past RDRAM in the wasm heap, so the page's heap grows (`CMakeLists.txt`).
- **The anti-piracy.** Four functions are reached only through pointers computed from words on the cartridge's bus,
  which the runtime doesn't map; a hook at each (`us.toml`) calls the function a cartridge leads to.
- **Spins.** The runtime runs one game thread at a time and switches only when the running one calls into it, where a
  console's interrupts preempt any thread. NuSystem leaves two threads spinning once the game runs (boot_main's
  endless loop and boot_idle's wait for an idle function the game never sets), and nuGfxTaskAllEndWait spins on its
  task count: each pass yields (`us.toml`). Without them the game hangs on a black screen at boot. A new hang with
  every other game thread waiting in `osRecvMesg` is another such loop.
- **Microcodes.** Graphics: F3DEX2, which RT64 knows. Audio: `aspMain`, recompiled by RSPRecomp from
  `aspMain.us.toml`. librecomp's vector unit uses SSE4.1, so `RecompiledFuncs` builds with `-march=nehalem` on
  x86-64.
- **Saves.** 1 Mbit of Flash. `main.cpp` declares `SaveType::Flashram`; the runtime keeps it in
  `saves/papermario.n64.us.1.0.bin`. The file menu reads a file with no save yet at slot -1, page -128, which a
  console's Flash wraps to slot 7, as the runtime's does.
- **Threads** (`main.cpp` names them): 0 the PI manager or the VI manager (by priority), 1 idle, 2 the crash screen's,
  3 the game's main at priority 10 or else audio, 4 NuSystem's graphics thread, where the game runs on each retrace, 5
  its task manager, 6 the controllers, 17-19 the audio's scheduler threads.
- **Stalls.** gfxRetrace_Callback steps the game on each retrace before it checks how many graphics tasks are pending,
  which holds back only its drawing, and its lists are in two buffers. So when RT64 stalls in one list, the game runs
  on and rewrites what RT64 is still reading: a page trapped or stopped drawing, and on Mesa's software Vulkan the
  desktop build read a list of 0xFF words without end. `ULTRAMODERN_VIS_WAIT_FOR_RENDERER` sends no VI while RT64 is
  stalled, on the page and here on the desktop too (`CMakeLists.txt`).
- **The ending.** The parade (end_00) loads its sprites into a sprite heap with room only for no partner out, as the
  game's own ending leaves it (hos_10 clears the partner). A warp there with a partner traps in decode_yay0.
- **Input.** RecompFrontend's default bindings. Keyboard: WASD the stick, Space A, Left Shift B, Q Z, R R, E L, Enter
  Start, the arrows the C buttons. The game reads port 1 only.
- **Widescreen** (`patches/widescreen.c`, its header says how). RecompFrontend's Graphics tab defaults to Aspect Ratio
  Expand, HUD Placement 16:9, Resolution Auto and Framerate Display. RT64 widens the 3D, but the game keeps the world
  inside its own frame, by its cameras' scissors and a background drawn only in the 4:3 picture: the patches open a
  camera whose view is the whole width to the window's sides and draw the background across, and a smaller view (the
  intro story's, the demo's framed picture) keeps the game's frame. A dark room's light and the pause menu's blurred
  world are widened there too. `patches/extended_gbi.c` turns on RT64's extended
  commands at the start of each of the game's display lists, since RT64 turns them off at each. Original (Aspect
  Ratio Original) is the console's 4:3.
- **Testing.** `--boot` starts the game from the launcher's first frame once the ROM is stored, `--window <w>x<h>`
  sizes the window, and `--input <file>` plays port 1 from a script of timed button states (`main.cpp` says the
  format), for unattended runs.
